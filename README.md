# liteweight

liteweight is a really small CSS framework I made to help teach basic HTML, CSS, and maybe some SASS. It promotes clean, responsive design, but also is in no means perfect. It's just here to be small and educational. If you've got any pointers or bug fixes, PR's and forks are fully welcome.

## File Structure

Here's a general idea of each of the important files:

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `lightweight.css` | The one CSS file you need. Compiled from `lightweight.scss`. Use this for distribution/download. |
| `lightweight.scss` | The SCSS file that compiles into `lightweight.css`. Use to modify variables and general scheme. |
